            <h1>Aeropress: Indestructable Brewing</h1>
            <h3>Kia Ora peeps, welcome to yet another instalment of coffee basics. Today, the Aeropress.
            </h3>

            <p>The wild world of coffee can be intimidating but there are a few staples in home brewing. All of which will get you away from that NASTY instant coffee (which also includes you’re ‘granulated’ coffee Janice.)</p>

            <p>Today we step into the world of the most indestructible, functional and tasty coffee brewing apparatuses which also takes the award for ‘Worst Instructions Ever’ for the last 14 years running. We will get to that though.</p>

            <h2>What is a Aeropress</h2>
            <p>Back in 2005 the president of Aerobie, Mr Alan Adler invented the Aerobie Aeropress (who is apparently also a fan of alliteration).
                The Aeropress is a filter styled coffee maker which produces a clean and bright flavour much like a pour over.
                It is made up of four parts. ish.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A couple of nesting cylinders that you push to apply pressure for extraction.</li>
                    <li>A cap made from a thick plastic (easy to lose)</li>
                    <li>A filter which will be either paper or metal. The plastic itself is BPA free but what isn’t these days?</li>
                </ul>
            <p>The Aeropress generally produces stronger as the coffee itself ‘steeps’ for a longer period before extraction. Similar to a plunger/french press.
                When extracting it requires a fair bit of elbow grease depending on your dosage so I wouldn’t recommend buying one of these for your old Gran.
                </p>
            <h2>How To Actually Make an Aeropress</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Disregard all factory instructions. They are BAD.</li>
                <li>Put plunger in bottom of cylinder <em>(hehe)</em> and stand up on the plunger end.</li>
                <li>Fill with 15g of coffee which is about a heaped scoop. Then put "some" water in, enough to be able to stir</li>
                <li>Agitate (the fancy word for stiring) for about 10 seconds.</li>
                <li>Fill the rest of the chamber and screw lid on.</li>
                <li>Pull chamber down far enough that coffee starts to push through the cap at the top.</li>
                <li>Leave to steep for 2 mins</li>
                <li>pop onto a cup, cap side down and then lean hard on it to push the steeped coffee through the filter and the cap.</li>
                <li>Enjoy! <em>(dont add milk you animal)</em></li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>I suggest it to everyone that asks about home brewing and its perfect for them unless they’re looking for something pretty for the bench that make large quantities of java like a <a href="chemex.html">Chemex</a>.</p>
            <p>Its a great starting point in your coffee journey thanks to it being so bloody hard to screw up and easy to find beans for.
                They make great gifts and are perfect for everyone except people lacking arms or your frail old grandma.</p>
                <p>11 out of 10 would brew again.</p>
