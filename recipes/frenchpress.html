    <h1>What is a French Press, What is it good for?</h1>
    <p>In the Aotearoa, New Zealand the land of the long white cloud you might be forgiven for thinking that us Kiwi’s are a simple bunch who enjoy our Gregg’s’s instant coffee a little too much.</p>
    <p>Perhaps we lack the sophistication for something as fancy sounding as a French Press.</p>
    <p>Most Kiwi’s will actually ask you what a french press is, how does one use it and why shouldn’t I just stick to my Nescafe instant.</p>
    <p>Let me tell you.</p>

    <h2>What is a French Press?</h2>
    <p>As fancy as the name french press sounds it’s actually a pretty simple and intuitive (code for <em>hard to fuck up</em>) piece of hardware. Depending on where you hail from it will likely be known as it’s other name</p>
    <p>In New Zealand, Australia and apparently South Africa it’s known as a plunger and makes ‘Plunger Coffee’ in France it’s called usually known as one of the big brands like Bodum or Melior. Finally, in Canada and America it’s known by it’s most popular name, the French Press. I’ll be using plunger and french press interchangeably throughout this article FYI.</p>
    <p>You can get your french press made out of every type of material you can think of. Glass, stainless steel, even titanium if you’re reeeeealy fancy. There are also plastic plungers and insulated thermos like plungers if you lack the time to brew coffee and then put it in your thermos.</p>

    <h2>The Gear</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The plunger, this has a mesh filter on the bottom which most retailers selt replacements for.</li>
        <li>The beaker, made from glass or plastic generally this is usually the firat part of the french press to break. Replacements are easy to find for the more high end ones.</li>
        <li>The stand, sometimes a fancy french press wont even come with this but theyre a pain in the ass. generally made from metal or plastic if it gets vroken youre usually better off buying a whole new plunger.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Et Tu Brew?</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your plunger. Much like a chemex the cold glass will quickly sap heat and energy.</li>
        <li>Pop in the reccomended dose of coarsely ground coffee.</li>
        <li>Add hot water and allow to steep for as long as you can be bothered waiting. 5 mins is often suggested but thats a long time when your'e thirsty.</li>
        <li>"Plunge" the coffee, pour a cup and enjoy the slightly gritty taste.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>The Bad Plunger Coffee</h2>
    <p>Although incredibly easy and pretty damn fast to brew the plunger does have clear pitfalls.</p>
    <p>Depending on what one you get often the build quality is terrible. The glass and stainless ones after time are in fact not stainless. And begin to rust, aesthetically this isn’t ideal on your kitchen bench.</p>
    <p>Not to mention you’re usually dealing with glass which, lets be honest WILL smash at some point. Replacements are relatively easy to find mind you.</p>
    <p>They’re OK for traveling especially if you have a plastic one that can take the bangs and bashes of being on the move. But they aren’t design for it and often there are better options for this *cough <a href="aeropress.html">Aeropress</a> cough*.</p>
    <p>This brings me to the largest problems with french presses, the dulled flavours and more heinously, the grit.</p>
    <p>Depending on both the quality of your plunger and the size of your mesh filter you’ll find an uncomfortable amount of coffee grinds and grit in the last two mouthfuls of your coffee.</p>
    <p>If you’re once of those barbarians who usually doesn’t finish all your coffee then plunge away but for most that morning ritual can come to an abrupt and mouth washing end.</p>

    <h2>To Plunge or Not to Plunge?</h2>
    <p>They’re often cheap, an easy gift and the grind is easy to achieve. They can be a right bitch to wash and generally have a dulled flavour, which can be a positive or a negative depending on your taste.</p>
    <p>In my experience an Aeropress is better in almost all situations. Lots of oldies swear by the french press coffee makers so I think there’s a fair bit of nostalgia about the whole concept which will eventually die out and we will move to better coffee making apparatuses.</p>
    <p>That’s just my take on it though, many more educated and experienced baristas and coffee aficionados will disagree with a simple man like myself.</p>
