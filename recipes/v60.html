   <h3>What is a v60? Whats it good for? Who is it good for?</h3>
    <p>Good morning sweet peoples of the internet. If you’ve found yourself digging about trying to figure out what on earth a Hario V60 is, put down your shovel and read on.
        A big fish in a big coffee pond the V60 effortlessly swims around on the top holding its own place among a LAAAAARGE variety of drip coffee makers.</p>
    
    <h2>But First, Heres a History Lesson</h2>
    <p>The incredibly simple idea of using paper filters to brew coffee was developed by the German wahine Melitta Bentez way back in 1908. Since then it’s had many iterations but remains largely the same.</p>
    <p>You have a holder of some sort that the filter sits in. Coffee of a particular grind goes in it and then slightly off boiling water is poured over it.
        The coffee brews and seeps through in a cup or carafe. Bingo bango bongo you’ve got yourself a hot cuppa joe..go?</p>
    <p>There are as I’m sure you are aware, automatic filter coffee makers. Things like the famous Moccamaster and the Wigomat (what a name) have been around for decades and essentially work on the same principles but just make a far larger pot of coffee.
        Automatic drip coffee makers are for another article though.</p>

    <h2>What on earth is a Hario V60? — and why is it named so badly?</h2>
    <p>Hario is a Japanese company that got it starts back in 1921 making heatproof glassware. They started with laboratory equipment, some of which you likely used in your high school science class you didn’t pay attention in</p>
    <p>During the 60s they ventured into household glassware starting with the coffee siphon and eventually picking up the V60 as a large part of their range.</p>
    <p>So here’s the interesting bit. V60, as it turns out of named after the geometric shape of the dripper itself which from the side is indeed a V and the angle at which the V sits at is; surprise surprise, 60 degrees. There’s also a wonderful video from Hario which explains how the ceramic ones are made.</p>

    <h2>V60 Accessories</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Hario V60 Scales — These things are the tits, I use them every day at work. They’re affordable and high quality.</li>
        <li>A Buono kettle — This is less necessary but it makes the actual pouring of water into your coffee significantly easier. However, they’re suuuuuuper expensive, especially for the electric one’s so unless you’ve got $180 burning a hole in your pocket I’d just stick out the regular kettle.</li>
        <li>Different filters — Theres different filters depending on the size of V60 you get. Theres only two so dont worry about having to many options. Otherwise theres a range of alternate unbleached filters and a couple of metal and cloth ones to pick from.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How to Brew a V60?</h2>
    <p>here is the complicated list of steps.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Look at the chemex <a href="chemex.html">how to.</a></li>
        <li>Do that but smaller</li>
        <li>Profit</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>To Drip or not to Drip</h2>
    <p>My main beef with the V60 and other filter coffee makers is the disposable filters. Sure they’re just paper but it would be ideal if the only wastage was the used coffee grinds. You can in fact track down stainless steel filters and even cloth one’s if you’re into that although I’d imagine the cloth one’s require an annoying amount of cleaning.
        If you’ve got a fancy friend who needs to up their coffee game and appreciates little elegant methods then a V60 is a pretty good choice. It has the feel of a connoisseur coffee maker without all the baggage of actually being one and will be sure to impress your heathen instant coffee drinking friends.</p>
    <p>With some luck you might even be able to get them to by one.</p>
